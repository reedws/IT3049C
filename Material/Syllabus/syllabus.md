        * You should all be added to the Team on Microsoft Teams. As many courses are also using MS Teams, I'm hoping this would be a familiar platform for you to use.
        * Try to ask all of your questions there, the TA and I will subscribe to the forum to get notified when an email is posted.
        * It's highly advised that you check your classmates questions and try to participate. (This will count towards extra credit points)

        * You can definitely use Discussion Forums, but you'll be in better luck on Teams

        * The Learning Center is going Virtual this semester. Hours will be announced soon.
