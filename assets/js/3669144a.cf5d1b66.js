At the root of your project, create a file named `jsconfig.json`, or `tsconfig.json` with the following content.\\n  - The presence of this file, indicates to VSCode that this is the root of a JavaScript project. You can use it to specify certain features you\'d like VSCode\'s JS Language Service to provide, such as typing. [Learn more about `jsconfig.json` file here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig#_why-do-i-need-a-jsconfigjson-file)\\n\\n```json title=\\"<root>/jsconfig.json\\"\\n{}\\n```\\n**OR**\\n```json title=\\"<root>/tsconfig.json\\"\\n{\\n  \\"allowJs\\": true\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. At the root of your project, create a folder named `defs`,  `types`, or `typings`.\\n3. Download and the save [`phaser.d.ts`](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/raw/master/types/phaser.d.ts) file into that folder. This file contains the definitions for Phaser.\\n\\n> Note: you may need to install TypeScript to your project or globally\\n```bash\\nnpm install --save-dev typescript\\n```\\nOR\\n```bash\\nnpm install --global typescript\\n```\\n\\n### Other untested alternatives\\nThe following repos seemed like good templates to use for Phaser Development.

Settings Sync lets you share your Visual Studio Code configurations such as settings, keybindings, and installed extensions across your machines so you are always working with your favorite setup.\\n\\nYou can turn on Settings Sync using the Turn On Settings Sync... entry in the Manage gear menu at the bottom of the Activity Bar.\\n<img alt=\\"Turn on Sync command\\" src={require(\'./assets/1-turn-on-sync.png\').default} style={{border: `1px solid black`, marginBottom:`2em`}} />\\n\\nYou will be asked to sign in and what preferences you would like to sync. Generally, you will want to sync everything but there is a case to turn some of these off on some devices.\\n<img alt=\\"Settings Sync configure dialog\\" src={require(\'./assets/2-sync-configure.png\').default} style={{border: `1px solid black`, marginBottom:`2em`}} />\\n\\nSelecting the Sign in & Turn on button will ask you to choose between signing in with your Microsoft or GitHub account. I recommend using your GitHub account since you will most likely need to sign in with GitHub for other extensions.\\n<img alt=\\"Settings Sync configure dialog\\" src={require(\'./assets/3-sync-accounts.png\').default} style={{border: `1px solid black`, marginBottom:`2em`}} />\\n\\nAfter making this selection, the browser will open so that you can sign in to your Microsoft or GitHub account. When a Microsoft account is chosen, you can use either personal accounts, such as Outlook accounts, or Azure accounts, and you can also link a GitHub account to a new or existing Microsoft account.\\n\\nAfter signing in, Settings Sync will be turned on and continue to synchronize your preferences automatically in the background.\\n\\nFor more information on Settings Sync, see this article from Microsoft: [Settings Sync](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/settings-sync).\\n\\n## Some of my Extensions\\n\\n- [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)\\n- [Auto Rename Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-rename-tag)\\n- [Babel JavaScript](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=mgmcdermott.vscode-language-babel)\\n- [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)\\n- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)\\n- [indent-rainbow](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow)\\n- [Todo Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)\\n- [Path Intellisense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=christian-kohler.path-intellisense)\\n- [GitHub Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot)"}]}')}}]);
