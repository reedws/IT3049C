It comes with built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages (such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go) and runtimes (such as .NET and Unity)\\"[^(2)]\\n\\n[^(2)]: [What is Visual Studio Code?](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense#:~:text=IntelliSense%20is%20a%20general%20term,%2C%20and%20%22code%20hinting.%22). \\n\\n### What is Intellisense?\\n> \\"IntelliSense is a general term for various code editing features including: code completion, parameter info, quick info, and member lists.

At the root of your project, create a file named `jsconfig.json`, or `tsconfig.json` with the following content.\\n  - The presence of this file, indicates to VSCode that this is the root of a JavaScript project. You can use it to specify certain features you\'d like VSCode\'s JS Language Service to provide, such as typing. [Learn more about `jsconfig.json` file here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig#_why-do-i-need-a-jsconfigjson-file)\\n\\n```json title=\\"<root>/jsconfig.json\\"\\n{}\\n```\\n**OR**\\n```json title=\\"<root>/tsconfig.json\\"\\n{\\n  \\"allowJs\\": true\\n}\\n```\\n\\n2. At the root of your project, create a folder named `defs`,  `types`, or `typings`.\\n3. Download and the save [`phaser.d.ts`](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/raw/master/types/phaser.d.ts) file into that folder. This file contains the definitions for Phaser.\\n\\n> Note: you may need to install TypeScript to your project or globally\\n```bash\\nnpm install --save-dev typescript\\n``` \\nOR \\n```bash\\nnpm install --global typescript\\n```\\n\\n### Other untested alternatives\\nThe following repos seemed like good templates to use for Phaser Development.
