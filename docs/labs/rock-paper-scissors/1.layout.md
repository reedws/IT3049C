## Game Flow
The game flow should be:
1. Web page loads with a form for the user to enter their name.
    * input is required, users cannot proceed without providing their name.
2. After the user submits their name, a new form appears with an input for Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
    * You can use:
      * select/dropdown
      * OR buttons
      * clickable text (but why would you do that!)
3. User submits the form with their selection (
    * input is required, they cannot submit it without a selection
4. CPU Player (Behind the scenes), would:
    * generate a (random) response to play against the user.
    * Compare the selections to determine the winner.
    * Keep a log of selections and winners for each round.
6. Web page would display the winner.
7. Show the game log
8. Reset the form after each round
9. User should be able to start a new game.

* Change the web page HTML title to *Rock Paper Scissors*
* **Inside** the `<div class="container">`, create the following elements nested as follows:
    * `<h1>` - with a title of *Rock Paper Scissors*.
    * 2 `<div>`s with IDs of `welcome-screen` & `game-screen`.
        * *Tip:* try typing the [emmet abbreviation/shorthand](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html#_emmet-snippets) `#welcome-screen+#game-screen` and hit enter. 😉

    * Inside `<div id="welcome-screen">`, create the following elements nested as follows:
        * `<form>` - with an id of `name-form`
            * `<div>` 
                * `<label>` - with: 
                    * text of *Your Name*.
                    * [for attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_label_for.asp) of `username`

                * *Tip:* [Emmet abbreviation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/html#_emmet-snippets) for a div with an id of `score-tally` and a paragraph with id of `score` is `#score-tally>p#score`.
        * `<form>` - with an id of `game-form`
            * `<div>` 
                * `<label>` - with:

## Checkpoint
**It should now look like this.**
<img alt="initial look" src={require('./assets/1.png').default} style={{width:`100%`, border:`1px #ddd solid`}}/>
