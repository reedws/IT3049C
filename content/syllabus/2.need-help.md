## Search Online 🕵️‍♂️🕵️‍♀️

First, when you get stuck you should search online for the answer to your problem. This is a key skill for you to develop.

- If you have an error message, copy and paste it into Google. Read carefully each each result to find exactly what you want.
- If you're looking for ways to implement something, break down the your challenge, to smaller tasks and search for the smaller
- When looking up answers on StackOverFlow, Be careful that you only use Answers to questions that are quite recent (or uses the same versions as yours). Programming moves quickly!

## Study Group 👨🏽‍💻👩🏼‍💻👨🏾‍💻👨🏻‍💻👩🏽‍💻👨🏼‍💻👩🏾‍💻👩🏻‍💻

**highly recommended**
Many students learn better and faster when working in a group, so I encourage collaborative learning. You can work together in a study group with 2–4 students to discuss class materials, homework assignments, and projects on a weekly basis. However, each student must submit their work individually; your work should reflect your own understanding of the materials.

## Ask MS Team's `Questions ❓` Channel 🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️

- If you need technical assistance, please ask you question on *Microsoft Teams*.
  - While I'll do my best to get to your questions as soon as I can, but I will almost always be beat by your fellow classmates.
  - It's a great learning opportunity for you to help other students or to engage in technical discussion to find the answer together.
  - The class TA (if assigned) will also be monitoring the chat and responding to your questions.
  - If you're not able to come to resolution, please @me/mention me on the question thread.
- I will try to periodically check on the questions, comment or correct any answers.
- I highly advise, you regularly check your classmates questions and participate.
