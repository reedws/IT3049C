* I will do office hours on an as-needed, appointment-based system. Please ask your questions on the channel first, and schedule a meeting when suggestions on the channel aren't helping. Use the link on the top to schedule a meeting with me or the TA.

### Will I be responding to questions during the weekend?

Maybe. 🤷‍♂️ Depends on my weekend plans.

*But should you expect it?* **No**

  * except for the first few weeks when a TA hasn't yet been assigned.

* Most of the assignments will be accompanied by a suite of automated tests that can give you an early feedback on your work.
