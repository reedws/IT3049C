SOLID is a mnemonic acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
It stands for:
- **S**ingle responsibility
- **O**pen–closed
- **L**iskov substitution
- **I**nterface segregation
- **D**ependency inversion

In this exercise, we will introduce the first principle which states that "every class should have only one responsibility". We will do this by separating the code that controls the game logic from the code that controls and manipulates the DOM.

In the `scripts/rock_paper_scissors.js`, we will make a `RockPaperScissors` class that will contain all "logic" for the game (properties and methods). and in the `scripts/index.js` file, we will handle the user input and call methods from the `RockPaperScissors` class as needed.

This file, we will use [JavaScript Classes](https://javascript.info/class).

## `RockPaperScissors` Class
The class will include a few properties:
* username
* score: {user: 0, cpu: 0}
* gameHistoryLog: []

This class will only contain 4 methods:
1. `constructor(username)`
2. `generateCPUResponse()`
3. `determineWinner(userSelection, cpuSelection)`
4. `play(userSelection)`

```js
class RockPaperScissors {
    constructor(username) {
        ...
    }

    generateCPUResponse() {
        ...
    }

    determineWinner(userSelection, cpuSelection){
        ...
    }

    play(userSelection) {
        ...
    }
}
```
Let's start with one function at a time...

### `constructor(username)`
This function will take in the `username` as a parameter and set it as a property to the class. In the constructor, we will also defined all our variables and set them to some initial values/
```js
class RockPaperScissors {
    constructor(username) {
        this.username = username;
        this.score = {
            user: 0,
            cpu:0 
        },
        this.gameHistoryLog = [];
    }
    ...
}
```
#### Note:
* class property are declared with the `this` keyword.

### `generateCPUResponse()`
For this function:
1. Create an array with the following values 
```js
const acceptedValues = [ `rock`, `paper`, `scissors` ]
```
2. Using both [Math.random](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random) and [Math.floor()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/floor) methods, generate a random index number (0,1,2)
3. return the value of acceptedValue at the random index generated in the previous step.

### `determineWinner(userSelection, cpuSelection)`
This function will take 2 parameters `userSelection` and `cpuSelection` and will return one of the following values (`win`, `lose`, `tie`). 
* it would return (tie) if the user selection is the same as the cpu random selection.
* it would return (win) if:
    * user selection is `rock` and cpu selection is `scissors`
    * OR
    * user selection is `paper` and cpu selection is `rock`
    * OR 
    * user selection is `scissors` and cpu selection is `paper`
* it would return (lose) in any other case.

### `play(userSelection)`
This method takes in 1 parameter: the `userSelection`. It will:
* Get the CPU Random selection using the `generateCPUResponse()`
* Determine the winner using the `determineWinner(userSelection, cpuSelection)`
* update the score tally `this.score`
    ```js
        // if the user won the round
        this.score.user ++;
        // if the user cpu the round
        this.score.cpu ++;
    ```
    OR
    ```js
        this.score = {
            user: NEW_SCORE,
            cpu: NEW_SCORE
        }
    ```
* Add another historyLog entry to the game history array. 
    * the log entry should look something like this `Yahya selected Scissors, CPU selected Paper: Yahya wins wins`
    ```js
    this.gameHistoryLog.push(`Yahya selected Scissors, CPU selected Paper: Yahya wins wins`);
    ```

## Result
**Running the unit tests should pass**
