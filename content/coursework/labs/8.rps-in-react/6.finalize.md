## Publishing to GitHub Pages
>
> There's a bit of different process for publishing a react application to github pages.

## Submitting the assignment

On canvas, you need to submit:

1. Link to your GitHub Repository.
2. Link to your hosted GitHub Page.

## Don't Forget to

* You don't fill out the self-evaluation and self-grading section on the `README.md` file.
* You upload your assignment into GitHub instead of properly using GitHub commits and pushes.
